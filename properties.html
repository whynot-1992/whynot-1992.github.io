    <p>
        Qubits have strange properties that make them unique and different from ordinary bits.
        Some of these properties include Entanglement and Superpositioning. Entanglement is 
        where two or more Qubits are linked together in such a way that the state of one qubit
        can affect the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. Superpositioning
        is where a qubit can be in multiple states at once, allowing for more complex calculations
        to be performed simultaneously. As soon as a qubit is measured, it collapses
        into one of its possible states. This is what makes quantum computing so different and much
        more powerful than classic computing.
